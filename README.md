# PONG-VHDL
This is a Pong game project implemented in VHDL, running on an FPGA from the MAX10 family. The development was carried out in Quartus, combining scripts and block diagrams. It was created in 2024 as the final project for the Digital Circuits course at UTFPR.

This repository contains Quartus compilation files. The main files are .vhdl files, and there are also block diagrams that represent the connections among components.
